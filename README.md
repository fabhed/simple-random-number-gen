For this task, we will use Flask, a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

Here are the core files, classes, and functions that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application instance and the route for generating random numbers.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML template for our website. It will display the random number generated by our Flask application.

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that our application needs to run.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
